# deep-learning-book
Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow et al. Ported to jupyter notebooks with my own examples in numpy/Tensorflow and additional exercises.
Deep Learning Book and associated resources are available for free at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/. Much thanks to Ian Goodfellow, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio for their authorship and distribution of th text.

### Numpy/Tensorflow Examples
The reader is encouraged to run the given code blocks on his/her own device. I would highly suggest playing around with the code fragments to generate examples of your own.

### Text Examples
These notebooks contain several text examples, contained within green blocks. These are pencil-and-paper exercises intended to deepen and solidify the reader's understanding. Solutions for each chapter can be found at the end of the corresponding notebook.

### Remarks
The notebooks for chapters 2-4 contain the entirety of the text given by the corresponding chapters in Deep Learning Book. Subsequent chapters will contain abbreviated notes and examples only.
