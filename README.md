# deep-learning-book
Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow et al. Ported to jupyter notebooks with my own examples in numpy/Tensorflow and additional exercises.
Deep Learning Book and associated resources are available for free as a digital copy at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ or for purchase as a physical copy at https://goo.gl/6wgDuK (Amazon). Much thanks to Ian Goodfellow, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio for their authorship and distribution of the text! 

This repository is currently an ongoing work, with an expected completion date of May 2018.

### Numpy/Tensorflow Examples
The reader is encouraged to run the given code blocks on his/her own device. It is highly suggested that the reader spend some amount of time playing around with the code fragments, generating further examples of his/her own.

### Text Examples
These notebooks contain several text examples, contained within green blocks. These are pencil-and-paper exercises intended to deepen and solidify the reader's understanding. Solutions for each chapter can be found at the end of the corresponding notebook.

### Remarks
The notebooks for chapters 2-4 contain the entirety of the text given by the corresponding chapters in Deep Learning Book. Subsequent chapters will contain abbreviated notes and examples only.
