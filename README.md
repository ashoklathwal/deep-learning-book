# deep-learning-book
Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow et al. Ported to jupyter notebooks with my own examples in numpy/Tensorflow and additional exercises.

## Numpy/Tensorflow Examples
The reader is encouraged to run the given code blocks on his/her own device. I would highly suggest playing around with the code fragments to generate examples of your own.

## Text Examples
These notebooks contain several text examples, contained within green blocks. These are pencil-and-paper exercises intended to deepen and solidify the reader's understanding. Solutions for each chapter can be found at the end of the corresponding notebook.

## Remarks
The notebooks for chapters 1-3 contain the entirety of the text given by the corresponding chapters in Deep Learning Book. Subsequent chapters will contain abbreviated notes and examples only.
